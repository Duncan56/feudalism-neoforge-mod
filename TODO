feat: implement full town system, commands, storage, and config integration

### Added
- Complete Town system:
  - Town creation, deletion, metadata (desc/MOTD)
  - Player ↔ town linking (TownPlayerData)
  - Leadership transfer, rank management (Leader/Officer/Citizen)
  - Public vs invite-only towns
- Full invite system (send/accept/deny)
- Chunk claiming:
  - Claim, unclaim, list claims
  - Claim limits (base + per member)
  - /town here (check chunk ownership)

### Commands
- Added every `/town` subcommand
- Added validation & detailed error messages
- Added command-only debug logging (toggle via config)

### Storage
- Implemented TownStorage:
  - Saves towns.json and playerdata.json
  - Loads cleanly on server start
  - Safe constructors to avoid config preloading crashes

### Config
- Added FeudalConfig:
  - BASE_CLAIMS
  - CLAIMS_PER_MEMBER
  - MAX_DESC_LENGTH
  - MAX_MOTD_LENGTH
  - DEBUG_MODE
- Correct NeoForge 1.21.1 config registration

### Infrastructure
- Updated FeudalismMod entrypoint
- Cleaned lifecycle logging
- Registered commands and events properly

### Notes
- Protection system not implemented yet (block break/place, interactions)
- Debug mode currently logs command-level execution only

This commit completes Phase 1 of the town/claim system.
